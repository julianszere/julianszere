## Welcome to My GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ”¬ About Me
- My name is **JuliÃ¡n Szereszewski**.
- I am completing my Licentiate in Physics (M.Sc.-equivalent) at the **University of Buenos Aires (UBA)** ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·.
- Iâ€™m currently conducting research on **Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks (KANs)** for modeling **nonlinear dynamical systems** as part of my thesis at the **Dynamical Systems Lab (LSD)**.
- Professionally, I work as a **Performance Analyst at Avature**, where I build **Python-based data analysis tools** to gain insights from large-scale web server metrics.

### ðŸ§© Featured Work
- [T.E.G. Analytic Probability Calculator](https://github.com/julianszere/TEG/tree/main) â€” Analysis of the winning probabilities for the argentinian game TEG, using Markov chains to compute the exact probability of winning battles.
- [Doppler Shift Simulator](https://github.com/julianszere/dopplerlights) â€” A Python simulation that warps and color-shifts images to visualize how they would appear at relativistic speeds due to Doppler and aberration effects.
- [PDE Solver with Images as initial conditions](https://github.com/julianszere/imagesolver/blob/main/README.md) â€” Evolution of PDE over time, with images interpreted as initial conditions.
- [Guitar Numerical Simulation](https://github.com/julianszere/strings/tree/main) â€” A numerical simulation of a damped vibrating string based on the 1D wave equation, playing Smoke on the Water from pure math
